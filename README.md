# corinthic

## What?

Corinthic is a web project designed to be the hub of what "me" is.

There are many aspects that contribute to a person's personality, and that may differ their online identity. I want to create a home, or a "space", on the internet for myself so that I may show the internet what makes me me.

## Why?

Mostly, just for fun. But the project came about from the DeGoogle movement that's been picking up steam this year, along with the mass disillusionment of the big tech sphere.

I want to go back to a time where people did something like this on MySpace or Neocities. This web project will have layers to it. Much like in real life, we present ourselves in a professional manner but getting to know someone requires going out of our way to explore. This is going to expect that of anyone that comes across the page.

## When

This is going to take some time to grow into what I have in mind. I ditched frontend as my priority discipline a few years ago. I mostly do stuff with Machine Learning and Big Data now, but fortunatenly that means I have the opportunity to pick up new things.

I am learning new frameworks, getting accustomed to new tools, all while conducting best practices for maintainability. This is gonna be a long haul project so I have to not hate looking at it a year from now.

For now, enjoy the Svelte placeholder.
